            <h2>How does this comic relate to a sacred text?</h2>
            <p>The Name of Text: Book of Genesis, Book of Revelations, Paradise Lost (John Milton), Nihonkoku Genpō Zen'aku Ryōiki (日本国現報善悪霊異記)</p><br>

            <p> Main Character: Akira Fudo, Ryo Asuka</p><p> When: Japan</p><p> Where: Unspecified, but contemporary with its 1970s setting</p><p>Summary: Hordes of demons, once thought entombed forever in the underworld, have now returned to Earth. Evil and corruption begin to seep into our world, as demons seize human hosts. Mankind’s only hope for salvation is to use the demons’ power against them–and only a pure-hearted man like Fudo Akira can do so without losing his humanity. Once little more than a crybaby, Akira now wields the terrible power of a devil, yet holds the innocent soul of a man–Devilman! (Description from Seven Seas Entertainment)</p><br><script src='js/function.js'><img  src='../img/gallery/gallery.5f2c5df4572259.05290388.jpg' onerror='onError(this)'></script>
            <p>Entry: Nihonkoku Genpō Zen'aku Ryōiki (日本国現報善悪霊異記) - When Ryo asks Akira to join him in his fight against the demons in the first chapter, Akira calls him "Lord Enma, leading me into hell" in reference to Enma-o, one of the buddhist judges of the dead.
Book of Genesis (The Hebrew Bible) - The character of Satan references God's creation and destruction of Earth.
Book of Revelations (The Christian New Testament) - The end of the series draws reference to the concept of Biblical apocalypse, including a several-headed dragon/hydra and a battle between an angel and a devil that seems to reference Revelation 12:7-9 "Then a war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 8But the dragon was not strong enough, and no longer was any place found in heaven for him and his angels. 9And the great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him. 
Paradise Lost (John Milton) - The story's interpretation of the character of Satan as a fallen angel is central to the story and last volume.</p><br><p style='white-space: pre-line'>External Links:<br> <a href=''></a><br> </p></div></div></div>   </section>
