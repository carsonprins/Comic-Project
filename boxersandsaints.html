            <p>Entry: Christian Dr. Won reads to Four-Girl (later named Vibiana) from the Bible at her request; she asks about Jesus and he decides to "begin with the beginning" (33). She is bored by the story of John the Baptist quoting Isaiah, and the story of Jesus's baptism (34-35), but she returns to hear many other stories, including the stone being rolled away from the tomb (47). She also learns to pray the Our Father/Lord's Prayer. The story of Joan of Arc (though not canonical) plays a pivotal role in this story as well. Father Bey quotes the Gospels in the context of the the Eucharist and sees "blood and water" from the side of a dying friend (147, 149). In a vision, Jesus tells Vibiana the story of the Good Samaritan (154-155) before the art shows his crucifixion and resurrection.</p><br><p style='white-space: pre-line'>External Links:<br> <a href='https://us.macmillan.com/series/boxerssaints/'>https://us.macmillan.com/series/boxerssaints/</a><br> </p></div></div></div>   </section>
